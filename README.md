# My Sheep
This is a free to use Web Application written in Flask that I have made to be used in Sunday School in my local church, This App is free for everyone who intends to use it for the same purpose, and without adding any commercial ads in it or any other related commercial stuff.
This is an open source project, Contributers are not only welcomed but also needed to modify and add features to the app. You are welcomed to use this app freely for your sunday school Whether your church is Orthodox, Catholic, or Protestant.

* Track their attendance easily in sunday school
* Add the visits you have made
* Automatically showing the attendance percentage and the number of visits for every kid in the main screen.
